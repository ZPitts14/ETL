# ETL
In my ETL Project we will be combining two datasets involving data from the National Basketball Association. We have collected our data from 2 different datasets discovered on Kaggle. In a ten-season span, 2007-2008 to 2016-2017. We will answer a few questions that can be useful to others in our new creation. 

Does height, points, rebounds, and win shares contribute to a team’s success rate, in other words winning an NBA championship.
